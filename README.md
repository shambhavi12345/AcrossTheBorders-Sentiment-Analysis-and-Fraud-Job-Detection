# AcrossTheBorders-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Fraud-Job-Detection
This project was made in order to analyze and classify the sentiments of tweets related to Syrian Refuges residing in Turkey and also to detect fraud job tweets using Natural Language Processing


PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Due to the ongoing conflict in Syria, many Syrians continue to seek refuge
in Turkey. This immigration has resulted in development of hatred in
Turkey for the refugees leading to global resentment. This hatred has
especially been in the form of social backlash especially via Twitter. Also,
many Syrian refugees are manipulated by Turkish criminals by offering
fraudulent jobs.


PROPOSED IDEA:
In order to counter the problem of online hatred via
Twitter, we decided to build a Machine Learning model
for performing sentiment analysis of tweets regarding
Syrian refugees in Turkey and segregate them
depending on their sentiment as positive,negative or
neutral.
This analysed data can be used by the Turkish
government to sue the potential defaulters
In order to track the fraudulent job tweets, we decide to
employ another ML model.
